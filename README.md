## 💫 `activerecord-exclusive-arc` 💫

A RubyGem that allows an ActiveRecord model to exclusively belong to one of any number of different
types of ActiveRecord models.

### Doesn’t Rails already provide a way to do this?

It does, but there are decent arguments against the default Rails way of doing polymorphism.
Consider the fact that the Ruby class name is stored in the database as a string. If you want to
change the name of the Ruby class used for such reasons, you must also update the database strings
that represent it. The seeping of application-layer definitions into the database may become a
liability.

Another common argument concerns referential integrity. _Foreign Key Constraints_ are a common
mechanism to ensure primary keys of database tables can be reliably used as foreign keys on others.
This becomes harder to enforce in the databse when a string column that represents a Ruby class is
one of the components required for unique identification.

### So how does this work?

It reduces the boilerplate of managing a _Polymorphic Assication_ modeled as a pattern called an
_Exclusive Arc_, where each potential polymorphic reference has its own foreign key. This maps
nicely to a set of optional `belongs_to` relationships, some polymorphic convenience methods, and a
database check constraint with a matching `ActiveRecord` validation.

## How to use

Firstly, add the gem to your `Gemfile` and `bundle install`:

```ruby
gem "activerecord-exclusive-arc"
```

The feature set of this gem is offered via a Rails generator command:

```
bin/rails g exclusive_arc <Model> <arc> <belongs_to1> <belongs_to2> ...
```

This assumes you already have a `<Model>`. The `<arc>` is the name of the polymorphic association
you want to establish that may either be a `<belongs_to1>`, `<belongs_to2>`, etc. Say we ran:

```
bin/rails g exclusive_arc Comment commentable post comment
```

This will inject code into your `Comment` Model:

```ruby
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  include ExclusiveArc::Model
  has_exclusive_arc :commentable, [:post, :comment]
end
```

At a high-level, this essentially transpiles to the following:

```ruby
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :post, optional: true
  belongs_to :comment, optional: true
  validate :post_or_comment_present?

  def commentable
    @commentable ||= (post || comment)
  end

  def commentable=(post_or_comment)
    @commentable = post_or_comment
  end
end
```

It's a bit more involved than that, but it demonstrates the essense of the API as an `ActiveRecord` user.

If you need to customize a specific `belongs_to` relationship, you can do so by declaring it before
`has_exclusive_arc`:

```ruby
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  include ExclusiveArc::Model
  belongs_to :post, -> { where(comments_enabled: true) }, optional: true
  has_exclusive_arc :commentable, [:post, :comment]
end
```

Continuing with our example, the generator command would also produce a migration that looks like
this:

```ruby
class CommentCommentableExclusiveArc < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def change
    add_reference :comments, :post, foreign_key: true, index: {where: "post_id IS NOT NULL"}
    add_reference :comments, :comment, foreign_key: true, index: {where: "comment_id IS NOT NULL"}
    add_check_constraint(
      :comments,
      "(CASE WHEN post_id IS NULL THEN 0 ELSE 1 END + CASE WHEN comment_id IS NULL THEN 0 ELSE 1 END) = 1",
      name: :commentable
    )
  end
end
```

The check constraint ensures `ActiveRecord` validations can’t be bypassed to break the fabeled
rule - "There Can Only Be One️". Traditional foreign key constraints can be used and the partial
indexes provide improved lookup performance for each individual polymorphic assoication.

### Exclusive Arc Options

Some options are available to the generator command. You can see them with:

```
$ bin/rails g exclusive_arc --help
Usage:
  rails generate exclusive_arc NAME [arc belongs_to1 belongs_to2 ...] [options]

Options:
  [--optional], [--no-optional]                                          # Exclusive arc is optional
  [--skip-foreign-key-constraints], [--no-skip-foreign-key-constraints]  # Skip foreign key constraints
  [--skip-foreign-key-indexes], [--no-skip-foreign-key-indexes]          # Skip foreign key partial indexes
  [--skip-check-constraint], [--no-skip-check-constraint]                # Skip check constraint

Adds an Exclusive Arc to an ActiveRecord model and generates the migration for it
```

Notably, if you want to make an Exclusive Arc optional, you can use the `--optional` flag. This will
adjust the definition in your `ActiveRecord` model and loosen both the validation and database check
constraint so that there can be 0 or 1 foreign keys set for the polymorphic reference.

### Compatibility

Currently `activerecord-exclusive-arc` is tested against a matrix of:
* Ruby 2.7 and 3.2
* Rails 6.1 and 7.0
* `postgresql` and `sqlite3` database adapters
