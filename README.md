## 💫 `activerecord-exclusive-arc` 💫

A RubyGem that allows an ActiveRecord model to exclusively belong to one of any number of different
types of ActiveRecord models.

### Doesn’t Rails already provide a way to do this?

Yes but [here’s a post about why this exists](https://waymondo.com/posts/are-exclusive-arcs-evil/).

### So how does this work?

It reduces the boilerplate of managing a _Polymorphic Assication_ modeled as a pattern called an
_Exclusive Arc_, where each potential polymorphic reference has its own foreign key. This maps
nicely to a set of optional `belongs_to` relationships, some polymorphic convenience methods, and a
database check constraint with a matching `ActiveRecord` validation.

## How to use

Firstly, add the gem to your `Gemfile` and `bundle install`:

```ruby
gem "activerecord-exclusive-arc"
```

The feature set of this gem is offered via a Rails generator command:

```
bin/rails g exclusive_arc <Model> <arc> <belongs_to1> <belongs_to2> ...
```

This assumes you already have a `<Model>`. The `<arc>` is the name of the polymorphic association
you want to establish that may either be a `<belongs_to1>`, `<belongs_to2>`, etc. Say we ran:

```
bin/rails g exclusive_arc Comment commentable post comment
```

This will inject code into your `Comment` Model:

```ruby
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  include ExclusiveArc::Model
  has_exclusive_arc :commentable, [:post, :comment]
end
```

At a high-level, this essentially transpiles to the following:

```ruby
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :post, optional: true
  belongs_to :comment, optional: true
  validate :post_or_comment_present?

  def commentable
    @commentable ||= (post || comment)
  end

  def commentable=(post_or_comment)
    @commentable = post_or_comment
  end
end
```

It's a bit more involved than that, but it demonstrates the essense of the API as an `ActiveRecord` user.

If you need to customize a specific `belongs_to` relationship, you can do so by declaring it before
`has_exclusive_arc`:

```ruby
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  include ExclusiveArc::Model
  belongs_to :post, -> { where(comments_enabled: true) }, optional: true
  has_exclusive_arc :commentable, [:post, :comment]
end
```

Continuing with our example, the generator command would also produce a migration that looks like
this:

```ruby
class CommentCommentableExclusiveArcPostComment < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def change
    add_reference :comments, :post, foreign_key: true, index: {where: "post_id IS NOT NULL"}
    add_reference :comments, :comment, foreign_key: true, index: {where: "comment_id IS NOT NULL"}
    add_check_constraint(
      :comments,
      "(CASE WHEN post_id IS NULL THEN 0 ELSE 1 END + CASE WHEN comment_id IS NULL THEN 0 ELSE 1 END) = 1",
      name: "commentable"
    )
  end
end
```

The check constraint ensures `ActiveRecord` validations can’t be bypassed to break the fabeled
rule - "There Can Only Be One️". Traditional foreign key constraints can be used and the partial
indexes provide improved lookup performance for each individual polymorphic assoication.

### Exclusive Arc Options

Some options are available to the generator command. You can see them with:

```
$ bin/rails g exclusive_arc --help
Usage:
  rails generate exclusive_arc NAME [arc belongs_to1 belongs_to2 ...] [options]

Options:
  [--optional], [--no-optional]                                          # Exclusive arc is optional
  [--skip-foreign-key-constraints], [--no-skip-foreign-key-constraints]  # Skip foreign key constraints
  [--skip-foreign-key-indexes], [--no-skip-foreign-key-indexes]          # Skip foreign key partial indexes
  [--skip-check-constraint], [--no-skip-check-constraint]                # Skip check constraint

Adds an Exclusive Arc to an ActiveRecord model and generates the migration for it
```

Notably, if you want to make an Exclusive Arc optional, you can use the `--optional` flag. This will
adjust the definition in your `ActiveRecord` model and loosen both the validation and database check
constraint so that there can be 0 or 1 foreign keys set for the polymorphic reference.

### Updating an existing exclusive arc

If you need to add an additional polymorphic option to an existing exclusive arc, you can simply run
the generator command again with the additional target. Existing references will be skipped and the
check constraint will be removed and re-added in a reversible manner.

```
bin/rails g exclusive_arc Comment commentable post comment page
```

``` ruby
class CommentCommentableExclusiveArcPostCommentPage < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def change
    add_reference :comments, :page, foreign_key: true, index: {where: "page_id IS NOT NULL"}
    remove_check_constraint(
      :comments,
      "(CASE WHEN post_id IS NULL THEN 0 ELSE 1 END + CASE WHEN comment_id IS NULL THEN 0 ELSE 1 END) = 1",
      name: "commentable"
    )
    add_check_constraint(
      :comments,
      "(CASE WHEN post_id IS NULL THEN 0 ELSE 1 END + CASE WHEN comment_id IS NULL THEN 0 ELSE 1 END + CASE WHEN page_id IS NULL THEN 0 ELSE 1 END) = 1",
      name: "commentable"
    )
  end
end
```

### Compatibility

Currently `activerecord-exclusive-arc` is tested against a matrix of:
* Ruby 2.7 and 3.2
* Rails 6.1 and 7.0
* `postgresql` and `sqlite3` database adapters
